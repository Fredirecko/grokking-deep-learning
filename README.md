# Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew W. Trask

## Note - Project Status
This is a personal project. I am reading through the Grokking Deep Learning book by Andrew W. Trask. 

## Description
This repository is set-up as a general place to store my progress as I move through Andrew Trask's Grokking Deep Learning book. 

## Chapter 3 - Introduction to Neural Prediction: Forward Propagation
This chapter is the first chapter in the book to be project based. Objectives included explaining what a simple neural network does/is, creating simple networks, and making predictions with single input/outputs and multiple input/outputs.

Data->Machine->Prediction

Datapoint->Weight->Prediction

Input->Weight->Output

"The interface for a neural network is simple. It accepts an input variable as information and a weight variable as knowledge and outputs a prediction.  Every neural network you'll ever see works this way." - pg. 26

Elementwise addition sums two vectors. Elementwise multiplication multiplies two vectors. A vector is a list of numbers. For examples weights = [0.1, 0.2, 0] and input = [toes[0], wlrec[0], nfans[0]]. In our example you can take two vectors of equal length and multiply them together based on position and the sum the result to get the dot product.

## Chapter 4 - Gradient Descent
