# Grokking Deep Learning by Andrew W. Trask

## Note - Project Status
This is a personal project. I am reading through the Grokking Deep Learning book by Andrew W. Trask. 

## Description
This repository is set-up as a general place to store my progress as I move through Andrew Trask's Grokking Deep Learning book. 

## Chapter 3 - Introduction to Neural Prediction: Forward Propagation
This chapter is the first chapter in the book to be project based. Objectives included explaining what a simple neural network does/is, creating simple networks, and making predictions with single input/outputs and multiple input/outputs.

Data->Machine->Prediction
Datapoint->Weight->Prediction
Input->Weight->Output
